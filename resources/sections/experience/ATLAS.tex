Personally developed a novel multivariate statistical analysis of the semi-leptonic $\ttbar{}H (H\to{}\bbbar{})$ channel}  %https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/88000
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}Developed a generalized \textsc{C/C++} framework for the Matrix-Element MVA }
\hspace{4mm}\cvitem{}{\labelitemii\hspace{2mm}
Implemented \textsc{VEGAS} numerical integration algorithm from the \textsc{GSL} libraries}
\hspace{4mm}\cvitem{}{\labelitemii\hspace{2mm}
Created a kinematic variable transformation engine to optimize integration phase}
\hspace{4mm}\cvitem{}{\labelitemii\hspace{2mm}
Improved per event performance more than two orders of magnitude}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
Personally developed a Perl-based assignment portal to automate and optimize distributed resource allocation on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)}
\hspace{4mm}\cvitem{}{\labelitemii\hspace{2mm}
Created an \textsc{Html/Php} website for receiving globally-distributed user submissions}
\hspace{4mm}\cvitem{}{\labelitemii\hspace{2mm}
Created a \textsc{Perl} back end for automatically generating user submission scripts and for automated GRID job monitoring and status reporting}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
Managed a 3 million CPU hour analysis across the globally distributed WLCG}
