\section{\textbf{TL;DR}}
	I have a track record of working on challenging problems in the fields of particle physics and predictive modeling. In seeking out a varied set of projects, I have been able to develop disparate, yet complementary skill sets. Inventiveness and intellectual freedom motivate me, and I have only ever experienced this in the wake of truly difficult problems. As an employee, I use this motivation to actively prospect for such problems and deliver creative, effective solutions in close collaboration with my peers.
