	\textbf{Machine Learning Principles:} Choosing the right metric for evaluation. Deliberate data partitioning and model validation. Model selection, model tuning, understanding when more data will/won't help. Creating a unified pipeline to process expected inputs. Model health monitoring practices, covariate drift detection.}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
	\textbf{Deep Learning:} Knowing if, how, and when to apply dense, convolutional, and/or sequential models to the problem at hand. How to take advantage of pre-trained models for similar tasks.}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
	\textbf{Software Best Practices:} Consistent, modular, linted code. Thorough self- and external documentation. Versioned with a deliberate branching strategy. Thoughtful and consistent unit-testing and code review.}
