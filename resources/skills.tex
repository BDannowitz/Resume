	\textbf{Machine Learning Principles:} Choosing the right metric for evaluation, data partitioning, and validation. Model selection, model tuning, understanding when more data will/won't help. Creating a unified pipeline to process expected inputs. Integrating covariate drift detection into pipelines to avoid out-of-domain predictions.}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
	\textbf{Deep Learning:} Knowing if, how, and when to apply dense, convolutional, and/or sequential models to the problem at hand. How to take advantage of pre-trained models for similar tasks. Extracting bottleneck features from trained networks as a form of dimensionality reduction.}
\cvitem{}{\labelitemi\hspace{2mm}
	\textbf{Software Best Practices:} Consistent and linted code, with self- and external documentation, frequently versioned with a deliberate branching strategy, thoughtfully unit-tested, and code/model reviewed.}
